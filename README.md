# Financier - College Budgeting Web App

## Overview

Financier is a lightweight web application that helps college students track spending, plan budgets and manage income. The app runs entirely in the browser, so no server setup is required.

## Getting Started

   Then open `http://localhost:8000/index.html` in your browser. You can also open `index.html` directly without a server.
