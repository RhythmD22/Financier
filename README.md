# Financier - College Budgeting Web App

## Overview

Financier is a lightweight web application that helps college students track spending, plan budgets and manage income. The app runs entirely in the browser, so no server setup is required.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Launch a local web server from the project directory:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server
   ```
   Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser. You can also open `index.html` directly without a server.
3. If you prefer not to run a server, the latest version is hosted on GitHub Pages:
   <https://rhythmdesai22.github.io/Financier/>

## Progressive Web App (PWA) Support

Financier can be installed as a Progressive Web App on mobile devices:
1. Open the site in Safari on iOS at <https://rhythmdesai22.github.io/Financier/> (do not include `index.html` in the URL).
2. Tap the "Share" button.
3. Select "Add to Home Screen".
4. The app will now appear on your home screen and launch in full-screen mode.

Note: Make sure you're accessing the site at the root URL (without `index.html`) to ensure proper PWA functionality.
